# Titanic Disaster Kaggle Competition

Hello, everyone!

I'm leaving this space to be the repo of the analysis I wrote on the following link to my Medium Article.

At this time, I developed some classification models to predict the survivors of the Titanic disaster, the famous Kaggle competition. The code is written in the file `model-selection.ipynb`.

Check it out! :)
